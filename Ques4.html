            What kinds of apps are a good fit for AngularJS.
        </label>
        <div class="content-area sample-show-hide" ng-show="checked">
            AngularJS simplifies application development by presenting a higher level of abstraction to the developer.
            Like any abstraction, it comes at a cost of flexibility.
            In other words, not every app is a good fit for AngularJS.
            AngularJS was built with the CRUD application in mind.
            Luckily CRUD applications represent the majority of web applications.
            To understand what AngularJS is good at, though, it helps to understand when an app is not a good fit for AngularJS.

            Games and GUI editors are examples of applications with intensive and tricky DOM manipulation.
            These kinds of apps are different from CRUD apps, and as a result are probably not a good fit for AngularJS. In these cases it may be better to use a library with a lower level of abstraction, such as jQuery.
