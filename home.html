        AngularJS is a JavaScript framework. It can be added to an HTML page with a script tag.<br>

            AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives, and binds data to HTML with Expressions.<br>
        script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular.min.js"<br>

        AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.<br>

        The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.<br>

        The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.<br>

        The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.<br><br><br>

        Google is the company that developed AngularJS.<br>
        AngularJS is an open source project, which means it can be be freely used, changed, and shared by anyone.<br>


        AngularJS is an excellent framework for building both Single Page Applications (SPA) and Line of Business Applications.<br>
        Many companies are using Angular today, and there are many public facing web sites that are built with angular.<br>

        There is a website, https://www.madewithangular.com, that has the list of web sites that are built using AngularJS.<br>
        Within this list you can find many popular websites like Slack.<br><br><br><br>
        What are the benefits of using AngularJS<br>
        1. Dependency Injection : Dependency Injection is something AngularJS does quite well.<br>

        2. Two Way Data-Binding :.<br> One of the most useful feature in AngularJS is the Two Way Data-Binding..<br>
        The Two Way Data-Binding, keeps the model and the view in sync at all times, that is a change in the model updates the view and a change in the view updates the model..<br>


        3. Testing : Testing is an area where Angular really shines.<br>
        Angular is designed with testing in mind right from the start.<br>
        Angular makes it very easy to test any of it's components through both unit testing and end to end testing.<br>
        So there's really no excuse for not testing any of your angular application code.<br>

        4. Model View Controller : With angular it is very easy to develop applications in a clean MVC way.<br>
        All you have to do is split your application code into MVC components.<br>
        The rest, that is managing those components and connecting them together is done by angular.<br>

        5. Many more benefits like controlling the behaviour of DOM elements using directives and the flexibility that angular filters provide.<br><br>
