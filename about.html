        <label>
            <input type="checkbox" ng-model="checked" />
            what is ng-cloak?<br>
            Difference between ngroute and ui-router<br>

        </label>
        <div class="content-area sample-show-hide" ng-show="checked">
            The ng-cloak directive prevents the document from showing unfinished AngularJS code while AngularJS is being loaded.<br>

            AngularJS applications can make HTML documents flicker when the application is being loaded, showing the AngularJS code for a second, before all code are executed. <br>
            Use the ng-cloak directive to prevent this.<br><br>

            ngRoute is developed by the Angular team where as ui-router is a 3rd-party module<br>

            ng-route implements routing based on the route URL where as ui-router implements routing based on the state of the application<br>

            ui-router provides everything that the ngRoute module provides plus the following additional features.<br>
            These additional features are very useful for larger applications.<br>
            Nested states and views <br>
            Multiple named views <br>
